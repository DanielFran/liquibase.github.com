title: Liquibase IDE 0.6 Released
---
Version 0.6 of the Liquibase IDE and the Eclipse Plug-in have been released.  This version does not add new functionality, but does fix a showstopper bug that prevented the creation of change log files.

Information on downloading the new version is available on the <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/download.html">download page.</a>
