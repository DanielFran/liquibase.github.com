For those of you watching and/or contributing to the Liquibase source code, the repository has now moved from the old subversion repository at liquibase.jira.com to<a href=" http://github.com/liquibase/liquibase"> http://github.com/liquibase/liquibase</a>.


Liquibase extensions maintained by the main Liquibase team have also been moved to the liquibase github group at <a href="http://github.com/liquibase">http://github.com/liquibase</a>.


If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the <a href="http://forum.liquibase.org/#Forum/liquibase-development">Liquibase development forum</a>
