Liquibase 1.9.4 has been released. The 1.9.x branch continue to be maintained, even as work continues on Liquibase 2.0.


1.9.4 is primarily a bug fix release, but also introduces the following features:


- DB2 for iSeries support
- Improved Maven support
- executeCommand does not run under updateSQL etc.



As usual, you can download the newest version from <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/download">http://www.liquibase.org/download</a> and post any questions or issues to <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/forum">http://www.liquibase.org/forum</a>



We would like to thank Mark Logemann, Don Smith, and Oleg Taranenko for the patches they submitted.
