Liquibase Core 1.5.1 has been released along with the initial 1.5.x series Grails and IntelliJ plugins.

Changes to the core library are minor bug fixes including:

- Fixed failOnError logic
- Improved serial column detection in Postgres
- Rollback connections before close for DB2
- Other minor bug fixes

The Liquibase core library can be downloaded, as usual,  from  <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/download">http://www.liquibase.org/download</a>. The Grails and IntelliJ plugins are installed via their respective plugin managers

The 1.5 Maven plugin should be released next week after further testing.
