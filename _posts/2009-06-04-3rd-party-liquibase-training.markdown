On the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/agileDatabases/">Agile Database group</a> the other day, there was a message that mentioned that their company provided <a href="http://www.valtech.us/us/index/hot/agile_training/agile_database_design.html">a training course that included Liquibase</a>.


*Note:* I know nothing about the course beyond the link above, but I know there has been interest in Liquibase training in the past and this may be a useful option for some.


I am mentioning it because it is the first professional Liquibase training I have seen, and also because of their quote on the group: "Run, don't walk to liquibase.org and find out more about this lifesaver."
