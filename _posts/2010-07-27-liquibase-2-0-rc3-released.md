title: Liquibase 2.0 RC3 Released
---


2.0 RC3 is now available. Like always, you can download it from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a>.


RC3 includes:


- Bug fixes, including a change to how classes are loaded which should make it work better in application servers.
- The first 2.0 RC build that is pushed to the maven repository. We switched to pushing our jars to a new location, so if they don't sync with the central repository, let me know



The <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_features">2.0 features</a> and <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_upgrade">2.0 upgrade notes</a> are still being added to.



As usual, <a href="http://liquibase.org/forum">let us know</a> if you have any questions or problems
