title: Refactoring IDE Demo
---
A quick demo of the Liquibase Database Refactoring IDE is now available on the Liquibase site.

It shows how to connect to your database, apply several refactorings to your database, then update an independent database with the new changes--all from the comfort of an IDE environment.

The IDE is available as either a stand-alone tool or as an Eclipse plug-in.
