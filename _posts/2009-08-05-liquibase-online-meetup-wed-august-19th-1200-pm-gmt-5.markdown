We will be having an online meetup Wednesday August 19th, 2009 at 12:00 PM US central time (GMT-5) using the "Chat" functionality of the Liquibase community forum (<a href="http://liquibase.org/forum/chat/index.php" target="_blank">http://liquibase.org/forum/chat/index.php</a>).  To log in, you will need to be registered on <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/forum/">http://www.liquibase.org/forum/</a>


I will be there to discuss the upcoming 2.0 release, development processes, outstanding issues and feature requests, and anything else of interest to participants.  Planned time is 1 hour.


Hope to see you there
