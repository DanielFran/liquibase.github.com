The Liquibase hibernate extension has been updated for both hibernate 3 and hibernate 4.


This release adds support for catching changes to sequences and unique constraints as well as a few bugs around data type handling.


See <a href="https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate">https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase-hibernate</a> for more information and to download the 3.1 release.


*UPDATE:*  A null pointer issue was found in the 3.1 release and fixed in a now available 3.2 release.
