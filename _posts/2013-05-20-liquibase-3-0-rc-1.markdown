Since the 3.0 beta 2 release, I have been focused on the new liquibase.org website, bug fixes, performance improvements, API cleanup and additional automated test creation and fixup.


Work remaining in the final push to 3.0.0:


- Finish documentation of new 3.0 features (including a "what's new in 3.0" list)
- Finish Java API cleanup/documentation
- Clean up "fix in 3.0.0" Jira list that includes many issues that have already been fixed and others that will not make it for 3.0.
- Any remaining showstopper bugs found in RC1



My hope is to have 3.0.0 released in the first week of June.



*Download*


As always, you can download the release from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a> and direct any comments or questions for <a href="http://forum.liquibase.org/">http://forum.liquibase.org</a>


The 3.0 RC1 release is the first 3.0 release that is available through the maven repository as well. It should be working it's way through the mirroring process now.
