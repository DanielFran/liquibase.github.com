Although it is currently just a skeleton of what it will be, the Liquibase Extension Portal is now open at <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/extensions">http://www.liquibase.org/extensions</a>.


The goal of the extension portal is to provide:


- A place for database-specific or experimental functionality that has not/should not be incorporated into the main Liquibase library
- A single location for end-users to find plug-ins of value to them
- An easy way for 3rd parties to submit, manage and maintain plug-ins by providing a documentation wiki, issue tracking, and source control
- Documentation on how to create your own extensions for public or private use



I was hoping to improve the sample extension pages (set-identity-insert and vacuum) to provide a better template, but I wanted to get something out before the <a href="http://blog.liquibase.org/2009/06/liquibase-online-meetup-thurs-june-25-2009-1200-pm-us-central-time.html">online meetup tomorrow</a>. We will improve the content on the portal over the next week once real work settles down.



As always, <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/community">let us know</a> if you have any questions or comments on the portal.
