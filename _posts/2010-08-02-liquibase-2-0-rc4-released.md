title: Liquibase 2.0 RC4 Released
---


2.0 RC4 is now available.  Like always, you can download it from <a href="http://liquibase.org/download">http://liquibase.org/download</a>.


The main changes in RC4 are improvements to the Maven POM configuration, and a change to how Liquibase classes and extensions are found and loaded.


The <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_features">2.0 features</a> and <a href="http://liquibase.org/v2_upgrade">2.0 upgrade notes</a> are still being added to as well.


As usual,<a href="http://liquibase.org/forum"> let us know</a> if you have any questions or problems


*NOTE: There appears to be a bug, at least in the command line version.  I'm looking into it...*
